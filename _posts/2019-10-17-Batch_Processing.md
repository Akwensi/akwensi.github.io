# Batch Processing

this projct is aout batch processing

And here's some *italics*

Here's some **bold** text.

What about a [link](https://github.com/dataoptimal)?

Here's a bulleted list:

Here's a numbered list:
1. First
2. Second
3. Third

Python code block:
```python

    def test_function(x, y):
      z = np.sum(x,y)
      return z
```

R code block:

head(df)
```

Here's some inline code `x+y`.

Here's an image:

Here's another image using Kramdown:
![alt]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/perceptron/linsep.jpg)

Here's some math:

$$z=x+y$$

You can also put it inline $$z=x+y$$
